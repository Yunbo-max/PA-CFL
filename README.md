[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2503.12220-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12220)

PA-CFL (*Privacy-Adaptive Clustered Federated Learning*) is a federated learning framework for demand forecasting in retail environments with heterogeneous data. It groups retailers into privacy-aware clusters ("bubbles") using differential privacy and feature importance, then trains Transformer models for localized sales prediction.

## Key Features
- **Heterogeneity-Aware Clustering**: Groups retailers by feature importance to isolate data discrepancies
- **Adaptive Differential Privacy**: Dynamically adjusts noise levels per cluster
- **Poisoning Defense**: Filters malicious clients via risk assessment
- **Transformer-Based Forecasting**: Self-attention models for accurate predictions

## Performance
| Metric        | Improvement vs Local Learning |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| RÂ² Score      | +5.4%                        |
| RMSE          | -69%                         |
| MAE           | -45%                         |
